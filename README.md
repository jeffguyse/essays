# Truth-seeking essays

Usually I think my ideas are well-thought-through. It's not until writing them down that I realize there were glaring holes in my thought process.

I'm writing these essays to expose any fuzziness in my thinking, so that whereever my beliefs land, they will be built on strong reason.

Publishing them is a way to keep myself honest, making it unpalatable to succomb to the subconscious urge to handwave something that I think is hard to explain, but perhaps really I just haven't thought through it enough.

Inevitably, I'll make mistakes. Perhaps you'll notice an important one, and you'll be kind enough to politely point them out to me, so I can correct my thinking.

I hope you'll pick the essay(s) that most interest you, and read them with an open mind. Perhaps you'll learn from my thought process. I hope we all grow from this effort.

The topics I intend to write on are:

+ An answer to Christians about why the atheist perspective is coherent
+ An answer to atheists as to why the Christian worldview is coherent.
+ How should we decide which perspective/belief to adopt?
